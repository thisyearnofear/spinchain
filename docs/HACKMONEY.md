# HackMoney 2026: SpinChain Submission

This document outlines the specific submission details for the **HackMoney 2026** hackathon.

## Submission Brief

**One-Liner**: A **Dual-Engine Fitness Protocol** that combines the liquidity depth of Avalanche with the parallel execution speed of Sui—enabling AI Agents to run autonomous spin classes with real-time biometric telemetry.

**Core Innovation**: We're not just building "web3 Peloton"—we're building a **Hybrid Architecture** where financial settlement lives on EVM (Avalanche) while high-frequency performance data runs on Sui Move. This unlocks **Agentic Finance** for fitness: AI instructors that manage their own class schedules, liquidity, and pacing in real-time.

## Why This Wins HackMoney

### 1. Real-World Revenue Model
- Immediate path to profitability (ticket sales)
- No token speculation required
- Solves actual instructor pain points
- Market-validated demand (boutique fitness is huge)

### 2. Novel DeFi Primitives
- **Events as Financial Objects**: Classes are smart contracts
- **Privacy-Preserving Oracles**: Proof of human effort
- **Composable Incentives**: Badges integrate with broader ecosystem
- **Micro-Protocol Operators**: Instructors as autonomous economic agents

### 3. The "Dual-Engine" Architecture
- **Settlement (Avalanche)**: For high-value, low-frequency events (Tickets, Rewards, ENS Identity).
- **Performance (Sui)**: For low-value, high-frequency events (Heart rate updates, Route telemetry).
- **Storage (Walrus)**: For decentralized 3D route assets and raw biometric logs.

### 4. Prize-Winning Integrations
- **Sui ($10k)**: Uses Dynamic Objects and PTBs for real-time rider stats.
- **Avalanche C-Chain**: Deployed on C-Chain for fast finality and future Subnet expansion.
- **Uniswap v4 ($10k)**: AI Agents use custom Hooks to manage class token liquidity.
- **ENS ($5k)**: Every AI Instructor has a sovereign `.eth` identity.

### 5. Clear Adoption Path
- Instructors already exist (not speculative market)
- No "web3 education" needed for users
- Viral growth via share cards (built-in marketing)
- B2B2C model (sell to studios, reach riders)

## MVP Scope for HackMoney (Feb 11 Deadline)

### Must Ship:
1. ✅ **Hybrid Stack**: App connects to both Avalanche (EVM) and Sui wallets simultaneously.
2. ✅ **AI Instructor Studio**: Instructors deploy autonomous agents with dual-chain capabilities.
3. ✅ **Sell tickets (Avalanche)**: Riders mint attendance NFT (ERC-721) via dynamic pricing.
4. ✅ **Track Effort (Sui)**: Real-time telemetry simulated via Move objects.
5. ✅ **Issue rewards**: Incentive Engine distributes SPIN tokens based on effort proofs.
6. ✅ **Route Worlds**: 3D interactive WebGL visualization based on GPX data.

### Demo Flow (90 seconds for judges):
1. **Configure Agent**: Deploy "Coach Atlas" (AI) on Avalanche + Sui.
2. **Buy Ticket**: Rider purchases access on Avalanche C-Chain.
3. **Ride**: 3D Visualizer runs, simulating biometric data syncing to Sui.
4. **Claim**: Rider submits proof of effort; contract on Avalanche mints rewards.
5. **Analyze**: AI Agent reviews session performance via Walrus logs.

## Competitive Analysis

### vs. Peloton/Strava
- **They**: Centralized, extract all data, own relationship.
- **We**: Decentralized, user-owned data, instructor-owned economics.

### vs. STEPN/Sweatcoin
- **They**: Tokenomics-first, questionable sustainability.
- **We**: Real revenue model (ticket sales), tokens as bonus.

### vs. Other Web3 Fitness
- **They**: Single-chain bottlenecks (gas costs for frequent updates).
- **We**: Dual-Engine (Avalanche + Sui) for unlimited scale and speed.

## Team & Execution

### Key Roles for HackMoney
- **Smart Contract Dev**: Solidity (Avalanche) + Move (Sui).
- **Frontend Dev**: React/Next.js with dual-wallet providers.
- **AI Engineer**: Agent logic and "Route World" generation.
- **Product Designer**: 3D visualization and mobile UX.

### Success Metrics
- End-to-end demo: Create Agent → Buy Ticket (Avax) → Ride (Sui).
- Architecture documented: clear distinction between Settlement & Execution layers.
- Performance: <1s latency on route visualization and telemetry.
- Aesthetics: High-fidelity "Route Worlds" 3D visualization.
