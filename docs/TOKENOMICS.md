# SPIN Tokenomics

## The Problem

Most "X-to-earn" tokens fail because users earn them, immediately sell, and price collapses. No sustainable demand.

## The Solution: The SpinCycle

Every class payment automatically buys and burns SPIN. More users = more demand = higher price.

```
User pays $25 for class
        ↓
15% ($3.75) → Treasury
        ↓
DEX swap to SPIN
        ↓
    ┌────┴────┐
 Burn 20%   Rewards 80%
    ↓            ↓
Deflation   Staking + Challenges
```

## Token Utility (Why Hold?)

| Tier | SPIN | Discount | Annual Savings* |
|------|------|----------|-----------------|
| Spinner | 100 | 5% | $60 |
| Cyclist | 500 | 10% | $120 |
| Peloton | 2,000 | 15% | $180 |
| Century | 10,000 | 25% | $300 |

*On $100/month spend. ROI: 480%+ at $0.05/SPIN

Additional benefits: Premium AI agents, early class access, governance, exclusive challenges.

## Supply & Distribution

**Initial**: 100M SPIN fixed

| Allocation | % | Vesting |
|------------|---|---------|
| Community rewards | 40% | 4 years |
| Treasury | 20% | 2 years |
| Liquidity | 15% | Immediate |
| Team | 15% | 4 years |
| Backers | 10% | 2 years |

**Emissions**: Halve every 2 years. Deflationary after Year 1 via burns.

## Instructor Challenges

Instructors create competitions with verifiable metrics (ZK proofs):

- **Metrics**: FTP improvement, resting HR decrease, zone mastery
- **Entry**: 50 SPIN per rider
- **Prize pool**: Winner 80%, Platform 10%, Burn 10%
- **Result**: Zero instructor cost, high engagement, SPIN demand

## Cross-Chain

**Avalanche**: Primary trading, treasury buybacks, governance
**Sui**: Fast transfers, gaming integrations, low fees

Bridge: 1:1 backed, multisig secured.

## Economic Projections

| Daily Classes | Monthly Buyback | Annual Buyback |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 100 | $11,250 | $135,000 |
| 1,000 | $112,500 | $1,350,000 |
| 10,000 | $1,125,000 | $13,500,000 |

At 1,000 classes/day and $0.50/SPIN: 225,000 SPIN burned yearly.

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Low volume | Treasury reserves guarantee minimum buybacks |
| Price crash | Staking lockups + real-world utility |
| Bridge exploit | Multisig + insurance fund |
| Regulatory | Utility token design, no profit promises |

## Implementation

**Phase 1 (MVP)**:
- SPIN on Avalanche
- Basic tier: 100 SPIN = 5% discount
- Treasury buyback mechanism
- Simple staking

**Phase 2**:
- Full 4-tier system
- Instructor challenges
- Sui bridge
- Governance

**Phase 3**:
- Real-world redemptions
- Insurance pool
- Advanced ZK challenges

## Success Metrics

- Month 6: 1,000 classes, 500 holders, $50k treasury
- Month 12: 10,000 classes, 5,000 holders, $500k treasury
- Year 2: Deflationary supply, self-sustaining

## Key Insight

SPIN is valuable because the platform is valuable—not the other way around. Every workout makes SPIN scarcer.
