# SpinChain Roadmap

Last updated: February 2, 2026

## North Star
Privacy-first fitness DeFi OS that turns instructor-led classes into programmable financial events with verifiable, user-controlled proof of effort.

## MVP (HackMoney 2026 — Feb 11, 2026)
- [x] Contracts scaffold (ClassFactory, SpinClass, IncentiveEngine, SpinToken, TreasurySplitter)
- [x] Core UI routes: landing, rider, instructor, routes, builders
- [ ] Rider flow: ticket → ride → proof card (interactive)
- [ ] Instructor flow: class builder → deploy (mocked)
- [ ] GPX uploader + parsing (basic)
- [ ] Shareable proof card component
- [ ] Demo script + 90s walkthrough

## Phase 1 — Private Beta (Q1 2026)
- [ ] Wallet abstraction (Privy) + account linking
- [ ] Ticket purchase + attendance check-in wired to contracts
- [ ] Attestation signing service (MVP proof)
- [ ] Reward minting from attestations
- [ ] Instructor revenue analytics dashboard

## Phase 2 — Privacy Upgrade (Q2 2026)
- [ ] Client-side ZK proofs (thresholds)
- [ ] Optional Aztec integration for private mints
- [ ] Comparative proofs (percentile/relative)
- [ ] Consent & privacy controls UI

## Phase 3 — Route Worlds (Q3 2026)
- [ ] GPX to elevation + story beats
- [ ] Three.js runtime scenes + adaptive pacing
- [ ] World builder templates
- [ ] Replay + proof card embeds

## Phase 4 — Ecosystem Scale (Q4 2026)
- [ ] Multi-chain deployment (Optimism, Arbitrum)
- [ ] Instructor DAO + governance
- [ ] Sponsor SDK + marketplace
- [ ] Studio partnerships + platform integrations

## Product Design Principles
- Privacy-first: proofs only, no raw health data
- Instructor autonomy: economics + rewards owned by creator
- Composable incentives: tokens, badges, discounts, sponsors
- Clean UX: no wallet prompts mid-ride
