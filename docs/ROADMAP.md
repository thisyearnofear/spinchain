## Phase 1: HackMoney MVP (COMPLETED ✅)
Focus: Core protocol logic, immersive visualization, and live session mechanics.

### Protocol Layer
- [x] Wallet Integration (RainbowKit + Wagmi) on Avalanche C-Chain.
- [x] **Smart Contract Factory**: Instructors can deploy session-specific contracts.
- [x] **Dynamic Ticketing**: ERC-721 based access with bonding curve pricing.
- [x] **Attendance Check-in**: Onchain verification of participation.
- [x] **Incentive Engine**: Automated SPIN token rewards for effort.

### Immersive Layer (Route Worlds)
- [x] **3D Visualization**: Interactive WebGL route rendering from GPX.
- [x] **Story Sync**: Automated detection of climbs and descents as "Story Beats".
- [x] **Social Presence**: Ghost riders for shared class energy.
- [x] **Acoustic Feedback**: Synchronized audio triggers for performance cues.
- [x] **AI Route Generation**: Natural language route creation via Gemini integration.
- [x] **Consolidated AI Service**: Unified AI architecture for agents and route intelligence.

### UX & Social
- [x] **Instructor Dashboard**: Class builder with economic controls.
- [x] **Rider HUD**: Real-time glassmorphic overlay for HR/Power/Cadence.
- [x] **Social Proof**: One-click generation of shareable effort cards.

## Phase 2: Privacy Upgrade (Q2 2026) - IN PROGRESS 🚧
Focus: Cryptographic Zero-Knowledge Proofs and decentralized storage.

### ZK Circuits (Noir) - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] **effort_threshold Circuit**: Proves HR > threshold without revealing actual values.
- [x] **UltraPlonk Backend**: Browser-compatible proof generation (~500ms).
- [x] **Witness Generation**: Converts telemetry to circuit inputs.
- [x] **Circuit Tests**: Validated threshold met/not met scenarios.

### On-Chain Verification (Avalanche) - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] **EffortThresholdVerifier.sol**: Solidity verifier contract.
- [x] **UltraVerifier Integration**: Uses Noir-generated verifier.
- [x] **Replay Protection**: Proof hash tracking prevents double-claims.
- [x] **Batch Verification**: Gas-efficient multiple proof verification.
- [x] **Audit Events**: `ProofVerified` events for transparency.

### Selective Disclosure - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] **DisclosureBuilder**: Configurable privacy policies.
- [x] **Privacy Scoring**: 0-100 score based on data minimization.
- [x] **Statement Templates**: "HR > 150 for 10 min" without raw data.
- [x] **Verifier Service**: On-chain verification of disclosures.

### Walrus Storage - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] **WalrusClient**: HTTP client for Sui Walrus aggregators.
- [x] **AssetManager**: Domain-specific storage (3D worlds, telemetry).
- [x] **Compression**: Delta encoding for telemetry data.
- [x] **Redundancy**: Multi-aggregator failover.

### Local Oracle - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] **Browser Prover**: On-device proof generation.
- [x] **Telemetry Buffer**: 10-minute rolling window.
- [x] **Session Management**: Start/stop/intermediate proofs.
- [x] **Auto-Backup**: Secure storage to Walrus.

### Remaining Phase 2 Items
- [ ] **Voice-Guided Rides**: Real-time conversational control during sessions.
- [ ] **Multi-Route Training Programs**: AI-generated series across multiple days/locations.
- [ ] **Street View Integration**: Real-world route previews for enhanced immersion.
- [ ] **Privacy Subnet**: Dedicated regulatory-compliant subnet for health data.

---

## Phase 3: Ecosystem Growth (Q3 2026)
Focus: Scaling the business model and onboarding the fitness industry.

- [ ] **DeepBook Integration**: AI Agents execute limit orders for class token liquidity on Sui.
- [ ] **Sponsor SDK**: Allow wellness brands to fund reward pools for specific routes.
- [ ] **Mindbody/ClassPass Bridge**: Connect legacy fitness booking to onchain tickets.
- [ ] **Instructor DAO**: Self-governing body for protocol fees and route standards.
- [ ] **Multi-Sport Vertical**: Expand logic to yoga, rowing, and outdoor running clubs.

---

## Phase 4: Enterprise Scale (Q4 2026)
Focus: Institutional partnerships and planetary scale.

- [ ] **Studio Chain Integration**: White-label infrastructure for global boutique chains.
- [ ] **Privacy-Preserving Analytics**: Aggregate fitness trends for research without user exposure.
- [ ] **Dedicated Subnets**: Launch high-performance AppChains for biometric throughput.
- [ ] **Cross-Chain Rewards**: Composable SPIN utility via Avalanche Warp Messaging.
- [ ] **Wellness Vertical**: Insurance-integrated effort verification.

## Implementation Notes

### ZK Circuit Deployment
```bash
# Compile circuit
cd circuits/effort_threshold
nargo compile

# Generate verifier
nargo codegen-verifier

# Run tests
nargo test
```

### Contract Deployment
1. Deploy `UltraVerifier` (generated by Noir)
2. Deploy `EffortThresholdVerifier` with UltraVerifier address
3. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_EFFORT_VERIFIER_ADDRESS` in environment

### Package Installation (for Noir support)
```bash
npm install @noir-lang/backend_barretenberg @noir-lang/noir_js
```
